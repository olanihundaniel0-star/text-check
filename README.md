# text-check
# Simple Text Analyzer

A Python script that analyzes text input and returns statistics about word count, character count, and sentence density.

## How It Works
The script utilizes Python's built-in string methods to:
- Split strings into lists to count words.
- Detect punctuation to estimate sentence count.
- Calculate character density (with and without whitespace).

## How to Run
1. Make sure you have Python installed.
2. Run the script in your terminal:
   python analyzer.py
